# Shopping List App with Unit Testing

So, recently I was exploring about how unit testing in react works. and I learn from lots of tutorials about it, reading articles, watching videos etc. I was interested and decided to learn by doing. So, I just boot up a simple project, a shopping list app with tailwind css and I implemented the context API inside to manage the state. and I do the unit testing for each components and hooks.

Check the demo here: https://shopping-list-test.netlify.app

Run the project locally

```

# install all the dependencies
npm install

# start the app with dev server
npm run craco:start

# build the app for production
npm run craco:build
```
